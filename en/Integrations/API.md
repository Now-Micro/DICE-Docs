# DICE REST API

The DICE REST API is accessed via a token based mechanism that uses account credentials.  It does not rely on the API key system used for connecting Agents to DICE.  Swagger documentation is available for the API at: https://diceapp.nowmicro.com/swagger/index.html

## Service Account Recommendations
Creating a service account to access the DICE REST API is recommended.  A service account can have a limited role/scope and require less account maintenance over time.
