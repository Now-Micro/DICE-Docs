#Registration and Invites

There are two primary ways to register with DICE:
- Receive an email invitation from an Organization Administrator
- Visit https://diceapp.nowmicro.com, select Register and then ask your Organization Administrator to add you to a role

Registration does require verification of the email address of the account.  Please check your Spam/Junk folders and ensure you have verified your account.  You may receive two separate emails requiring action depending on your provisioning method.

If you have verified your account and still receive a message to contact your administrator, ensure your Organization Administrator has added you to a role and verify you have not received an account verification email.
