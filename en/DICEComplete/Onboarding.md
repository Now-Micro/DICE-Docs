# Onboarding DICE Complete

Onboarding DICE Complete can be simplified by deploying the agent to devices to populate a wide swath of information without having to upload existing records.

1. Deploy Agents via GPO, Microsoft Intune or Microsoft MEMCM.  See [Agents](/en/Agents/Agent.md)
1. Upload end user information (optional).  End user information is used to drive the Asset Management assignment processes
1. Upload asset information (optional).  Assets will be populated by agent check ins, but additional if
1. Invite tool users to DICE with initial roles

## Advanced
Since DICE is an API driven platform, data can be imported via APIs in additional to the UI driven upload interfaces. API information and example data structures are available in [Swagger](https://diceapp.nowmicro.com/swagger).
Please contact support if you need aditional assistance, including example scripts.
