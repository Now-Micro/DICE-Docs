# Asset Management Overview

Assets in DICE Complete can represent any item with a serial number.

Assets are automatically generated from order information, but can also be manually added, bulk imported with a Excel file or added via API.  See [Importing Assets](ImportingAssets.md) for more information.

Assets have additional properties, including:
- Location
- End User
- Status
- Check In/Out
